## Pull requests

Please note that this project is still in very early development and managing pull requests and new features may not receive full attention at this time.  
But if you really want to add something, please read below.

**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**

It's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature. To avoid this from happening, we request that contributors create a feature request to first discuss any new ideas. Your ideas and suggestions are welcome!

Please ensure that the tests are passing when submitting a pull request. If you're adding new features to Guardlight, please include tests.


PRs that address existing _bugs_ with a corresponding issue opened in our issue tracker will continue to be accepted
and reviewed. Their scope is often significantly more targeted, and simply improving upon existing and well defined
logic.


If you've found what you believe is a security issue please email `support@guardlight.org`.
